        " 1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Compiled Languages: The code is translated into machine code (executable code) before execution. This process is done by a compiler. Examples: C, C++. The entire program is compiled at once.\n",
        "Interpreted Languages: The code is translated and executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. Examples: Python, JavaScript. The interpreter reads and executes each line as it encounters it.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to deal with errors (exceptions) that occur during the execution of a program. It allows you to gracefully handle unexpected situations, prevent program crashes, and maintain control flow.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        " -The finally block in exception handling is used to define a block of code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred in the try block or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Logging is a way to record events that happen during the execution of a program. It provides a structured way to track the flow of your application, diagnose issues, and understand what's happening at different stages. Python's built-in logging module provides a flexible framework for this\n",
        "\n",
        " 5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It's used for cleanup operations related to the object's resources before it's removed from memory. However, relying heavily on __del__ is generally discouraged due to the unpredictable nature of garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -import module_name: Imports the entire module. You access its contents using module_name.item_name.\n",
        "from module_name import item_name: Imports specific items (functions, classes, variables) from a module. You can then access them directly using item_name.\n",
        "from module_name import : Imports all items from a module. This is generally discouraged in production code as it can lead to naming conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -You can handle multiple exceptions in Python using multiple except blocks or by providing a tuple of exception types to a single except block:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        " -The with statement is used for resource management, especially when working with files. It ensures that resources are properly acquired and released, even if exceptions occur. When used with file handling, it automatically closes the file when the block is exited, preventing resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        " with open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",

        " 9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Multithreading: Involves multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space. They are suitable for I/O-bound tasks (tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for input/output operations), as the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python can limit their effectiveness for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Involves multiple independent processes, each with its own memory space. They are suitable for CPU-bound tasks, as they can utilize multiple CPU cores.\n",

        "\n",
        " -Advantages of using Logging:\n",
        "Debugging: Helps pinpoint errors and understand the program's execution flow.\n",
        "Monitoring: Provides insights into the program's behavior in production.\n",
        "Auditing: Records important events for security or compliance.\n",
        "Troubleshooting: Makes it easier to diagnose issues reported by users.\n",
        "Flexibility: You can control the level of detail logged and where the logs are sent (console, file, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        " 11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Memory management in Python is handled automatically through a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The Python memory manager allocates and deallocates memory from this heap. It uses techniques like reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Basic Steps in Exception Handling:\n",
        "1.try block: Contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "2.except block(s): Catch specific exceptions that might occur in the try block and handle them.\n",
        "3.else block (optional): Executes if no exception occurred in the try block.\n",
        "4.finally block (optional): Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Importance of Memory Management: Efficient memory management is crucial for:\n",
        "Preventing memory leaks: Avoiding the accumulation of unused memory, which can slow down the program or cause it to crash.\n",
        "Optimizing performance: Efficiently using memory resources.\n",
        "Ensuring program stability: Preventing crashes due to out-of-memory errors.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Role of try and except:\n",
        "try: Encloses the code that is to be monitored for exceptions. If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution is immediately transferred to the corresponding except block.\n",
        "except: Specifies how to handle a particular type of exception. If the exception raised in the try block matches the type specified in an except block, the code within that except block is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        " 15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Python uses two main mechanisms for garbage collection:\n",
        "Reference Counting: Each object has a count of how many references point to it. When the count drops to zero, the object is deallocated.\n",
        "Generational Garbage Collection: A cyclic garbage collector is used to detect and collect objects that are part of reference cycles (where objects refer to each other but are no longer accessible from outside). It divides objects into generations and collects older generations less frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        " 16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        " -The else block is executed only if the code within the try block completes successfully without raising any exceptions. It's useful for putting code that should only run if no errors occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        " 17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Python's logging module defines several logging levels in increasing order of severity:\n",
        "DEBUG: Detailed information, typically only of interest when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or might happen in the near future (e.g., 'disk space low'). The software is still working as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
        "\n",
        "CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",

        "\n",
        " -Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing:\n",
        "\n",
        "os.fork(): Creates a new process that is a copy of the current process. It's a lower-level system call and is not available on all operating systems (e.g., Windows).\n",
        "\n",
        "multiprocessing: A higher-level module that provides an API for creating and managing processes. It's cross-platform and offers more features for inter-process communication and synchronization. It often uses os.fork() internally on systems where it's available.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Closing a file releases the resources associated with it, such as the file handle and any buffers. Failing to close a file can lead to:\n",
        "Resource leaks: The operating system might run out of available file handles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data loss: Data written to the file might not be flushed from the buffer to the disk.\n",
        "File corruption: The file might be left in an inconsistent state. Using the with statement is the recommended way to ensure files are automatically closed.\n",
        "\n",
        " 20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file as a single string. You can optionally provide a size argument to read a specified number of bytes.\n",
        "\n",
        "file.readline(): Reads a single line from the file, including the newline character at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        " 21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        " -The logging module in Python is used to add logging capabilities to your applications. It allows you to:\n",
        "Record events with different severity levels.\n",
        "Format log messages.\n",
        "Send log messages to various destinations (console, files, network).\n",

        "\n",
        " 22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        " -The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system. In file handling, it's used for tasks such as:\n",
        "Getting the current working directory.\n",
        "Changing the current working directory.\n",
        "Creating and deleting directories.\n",
        "Listing files and directories.\n",

        "\n",
        " 23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -While Python's automatic memory management is convenient, it can present challenges:\n",
        "Reference Cycles: Objects that form cycles can sometimes prevent garbage collection.\n",
        "Unpredictability of Garbage Collection: You don't have fine-grained control over when garbage collection occurs.\n",
        "Memory Overhead: The memory manager itself consumes some memory.\n",
        "Debugging Memory Issues: It can be challenging to diagnose memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.\n",
